# Doof

Doof is a podcast player developed in Svelte.  

In theory it should work with any server which supports the [SubSonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) and podcasts. However it's only been tested with  [Gonic](https://github.com/gonic/).

It is currently still very basic and not very useful.

## Intended Features

- add podcasts
- download podcast episodes
- play podcasts
- triage podcasts for future playback

Doof is a project for me to learn Svelte and get more experience working with APIs.  It will probably never be actually useful.
